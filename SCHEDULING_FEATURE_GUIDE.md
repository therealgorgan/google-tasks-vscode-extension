## üîß Next Steps / Future Enhancements

### Optional Improvements

1. **Visual Indicators:**
   - Add colored backgrounds for overdue tasks
   - Highlight tasks scheduled for today
   - Add task status icons

2. **Advanced Recurrence:**
   - Custom recurrence patterns (every 2 weeks, etc.)

   - Show overdue tasks at the top

5. **Bulk Operations:**

   - Copy schedule from one task to another

### Data Storage

Currently, the extension stores:

- **Due Date/Time** in the `due` field (Google Tasks API standard)
- **Recurrence Pattern** in the task description (can be improved with extended properties)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Details

### Google Tasks API Integration

The scheduling feature uses the Google Tasks API v1 `due` field:

- Format: RFC 3339 (ISO 8601) - e.g., `"2025-10-20T14:00:00.000Z"`
- Updated via `tasks.patch()` method
- Stored on Google's servers automatically

### Code Architecture

**DateTimeUtils.ts:**

- Converts between Date objects and RFC 3339 strings
- Formats dates for human-readable display
- Parses user input in various formats
- Provides time/date presets

**ScheduleDialog.ts:**

- Shows interactive quick-pick dialogs
- Guides users through date ‚Üí time ‚Üí recurrence selection
- Validates all user input
- Shows helpful error messages

**GTask.treeItem.ts:**

- Displays formatted schedule info in task description
- Sets context values for menu visibility

**commands.ts:**

- Orchestrates user interactions
- Calls the scheduling dialogs
- Updates tasks via TreeDataProvider

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Schedule Not Showing?

1. Make sure you saved after setting the schedule
2. Try refreshing the task list (button in toolbar)
3. Check that the Google Tasks API has permission to update tasks

### Date Format Error?

- Use `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., 2025-10-25) or `MM/DD/YYYY` (e.g., 10/25/2025)
- For time: use 12-hour with AM/PM (2:30 PM) or 24-hour format (14:30)

### Changes Not Syncing?

- This is a Google Tasks API limitation
- The extension updates locally but Google syncs across all devices
- May take a few moments to appear on other devices

## üìù Development Notes

### Building the Extension

```bash
npm install              # Install dependencies
npm run watch           # Watch mode (auto-compile)
npm run compile         # Single compilation
npm test               # Run tests
npm run vscode:prepublish  # Prepare for publishing
```

### Debugging

1. Press `F5` in VSCode to launch the extension in debug mode
2. Open DevTools with `Ctrl+Shift+I` in the extension window
3. Use `console.log()` statements in your code
4. Set breakpoints in VSCode

### Testing the Scheduling

1. Create a test task
2. Right-click ‚Üí "Set Task Schedule"
3. Select a date and time
4. Verify it shows in the description area
5. Try editing and clearing the schedule
