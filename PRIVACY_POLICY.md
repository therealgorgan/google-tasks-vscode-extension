# Privacy Policy for Google Tasks for VSCode

**Last Updated:** October 21, 2025

## Overview

"Google Tasks for VSCode" (the "Extension") is a Visual Studio Code extension that allows users to access and manage their Google Tasks data directly from their editor. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how we handle your data.

## 1. What Data We Access

The Extension accesses only the following user data from your Google Account:

- **Google Tasks Data**: Your task lists, tasks, task titles, descriptions, due dates, and task statuses
- **User Authorization Data**: Your Google Account identifier (only for authentication purposes)

## 2. How We Use Your Data

We use your data **only** for the following purposes:

- Displaying your Google Tasks in VS Code
- Allowing you to create, read, update, and delete tasks
- Maintaining your authentication session during runtime
- Providing task management functionality within the Extension

## 3. Data Storage and Retention

- **Runtime Storage**: Your data is loaded into memory only during the VS Code session
- **No Persistence**: We do **not** store, cache, or persist any of your data on your computer or any server
- **No Transmission**: Your data is **never** transmitted to any third-party services, servers, or external applications
- **Session-Based**: All data is cleared from memory when you close VS Code

## 4. OAuth Authentication

The Extension uses OAuth 2.0 to securely authenticate with Google Services:

- Authentication tokens are stored locally by VS Code's credential management system
- Tokens are used **only** to authorize API requests to Google Tasks
- We do **not** have access to your Google Account password
- You can revoke access at any time through your Google Account security settings

## 5. API Permissions

The Extension requests the following Google API scopes:

- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/tasks` - To manage your Google Tasks (create, read, update, delete)
- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar` - To access your Google Calendar for viewing tasks alongside calendar events

We request only the minimum permissions necessary to provide the Extension's functionality.

## 6. Google API Services

The Extension uses the following Google APIs:

- **Google Tasks API**: To retrieve, create, update, and delete tasks
- **Google Calendar API**: To display task due dates with calendar integration

## 7. Data We Do NOT Collect

We do **not** collect, track, or store:

- Personal information beyond what is required for OAuth authentication
- Usage analytics or telemetry data (except for VS Code's built-in telemetry)
- IP addresses or location data
- Browser cookies or tracking pixels
- Any data unrelated to Google Tasks

## 8. Third-Party Services

The Extension may use the following third-party services:

- **Google APIs**: Required for accessing your Google Tasks
- **VS Code**: The host application that runs the Extension

## 9. Data Security

We implement the following security measures:

- All communication with Google APIs uses secure HTTPS connections
- Authentication is handled through industry-standard OAuth 2.0
- We do not store credentials; VS Code's secure storage system is used
- No data is transmitted to any server we control

## 10. User Rights

You have the right to:

- Access all data the Extension displays
- Revoke the Extension's access to your Google Account at any time
- Request that we do not access certain data (by not authorizing the Extension)
- Delete all local data by uninstalling the Extension

To revoke access:

1. Go to [Google Account Security Settings](https://myaccount.google.com/security)
2. Find "Google Tasks for VSCode" in "Your apps with access to your account"
3. Click on it and select "Remove access"

## 11. Data Sharing

We **do not** share your data with anyone. Your Google Tasks data is:

- Accessed directly from Google's servers
- Displayed locally in your VS Code instance
- Never shared with, transmitted to, or stored by any third party

## 12. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be reflected in the version history of this document. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
